# Advent of Code 2023

Solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). This year's language of choice: Go.

To start a new day, copy the `daytemplate` folder and rename it to the correct day (`day01`, for instance). Uncomment the code in the `main_test.go` file if you want testing. Run all days with `go run main.go`. Run all tests with `go test ./...`. Inputs go in the `inputs` folder named after the correct day. Tests go in the folder for that day.
